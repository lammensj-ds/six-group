## Overview
This repository contains course material for Drupal site building and development. Each day's content and corresponding solutions are organized into dedicated branches, allowing for easy lookup and reference of the code.

## Contents
You can find the code for each day's exercises and their solutions in the following branches:

- [`day/3`](https://github.com/lammensj-ds/six-group/tree/day/3): Provides an empty theme as a starting point for development.
- [`sol/day/3`](https://github.com/lammensj-ds/six-group/tree/sol/day/3): Includes extra Twig files and overrides, along with a theme implementation for the `pirate_weather` module to render weather forecasts.
